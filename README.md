**CSE Undergraduate | Data Enthusiast | Aspiring Analyst**


**About Me**
<br>
I'm a passionate and driven Computer Science undergraduate with a keen interest in the world of data. I'm currently on a journey to equip myself with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in the field of data analysis.

**Goals**
<br>
My current focus lies in mastering essential tools like Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI. I'm actively learning and honing my skills in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. I'm fascinated by the power of data to unlock insights and drive informed decision-making. While data is my primary passion, I also enjoy exploring other creative and technical avenues. I have experience with graphic design, creating visually appealing posters and graphics. Additionally, I'm captivated by the potential of web development and UI/UX design, and I'm eager to delve into these areas in the future using tools like Figma.

**Let's Connect!**
<br>
I'm always open to connecting with fellow data enthusiasts, collaborators, and anyone passionate about technology. Feel free to reach out!
